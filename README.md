# DiDet
DiDet represents the acronym of Diameter Detector. This program is written to detect diameter distribution of polymer fibers from the representative SEM or TEM proflile.


# PRECAUTIONS

Use 30–50 probes for straight fibers

Use 50–100 probes for curved fibers

Avoid measuring very close to fiber ends

Draw ROI slightly inside fuzzy SEM edges for consistency

Use the same probe count across samples for comparison
